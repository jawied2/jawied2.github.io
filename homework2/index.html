            <p class="firstparagraph">Hi, my name is Jacob Wied, a recent graduate from UW-Madison with a Bachelor’s in Information Science and certificates in Data Science and Digital Studies. At UW-Madison, I was involved in a couple of organizations, including Alpha Phi Epsilon. Being part of this organization allowed me to connect with others who share a commitment to academic excellence and professional growth, while also providing opportunities for collaboration and networking that have been invaluable. This experience taught me the importance of building relationships and supporting one another in our pursuits. I was also involved in Badger Business Professionals, where I mentored underclassmen, guiding them through the nuances of job applications, interviews, and resume building.

            <p class="secondparagraph">In addition to my campus involvement, I gained valuable experience as a Junior Sales Representative at Quectel. This role honed my ability to effectively outreach and communicate with customers. It also has introduced me into the growing field of IoT, deepening my understanding of these parts and their features. Working in sales has also deepened my understanding of how effective communication and data organization can drive business success.

            <p class="thirdparagraph">
                I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of data and user experience, focusing on enhancing information accessibility. I believe that organizing and presenting data effectively is key to helping users navigate complex information. In today’s data-driven world, analyzing and interpreting data leads to actionable insights and informed decisions. As I start my professional journey, I’m excited to apply my knowledge in information science to projects that prioritize clarity and usability, empowering individuals and organizations to leverage data effectively.</p>
